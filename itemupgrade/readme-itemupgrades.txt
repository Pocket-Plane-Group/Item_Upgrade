		Section I. About
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Item Upgrade Mod Pack allows Cromwell and Cespenar to upgrade more
items for you. Half of them are conveniences, the other half try to prop up
weapon categories that are "weak" by comparison (e.g., maces and clubs). 

See Section III for an item list.


		Section II. Installation
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
BGII is required. ToB is optional but recommended. The Item Upgrade Mod
will install correctly over (or without) the Ascension Mod. It should work
fine with any WeiDU mod. See the webpage for details. This mod also works
on Baldur's Gate Trilogy or the Enhanced Edition of Baldur's Gate II or
Enhanced Edition Trilogy.

Unzip the main ZIP file into your BGII main directory. This is normally:
        C:\Program Files\Black Isle\BGII - SoA\

Run (click on) "setup-itemupgrade.exe". 

First, pick your favorite language. Currently available: 
  American English

                     &  Cocobard (bardbards@planetis.com)

  German Translation by Maus (maus@fphfslinux.physik.uni-karlsruhe.de)

                     & AERIE.RU
  Korean Translation by web2air

Then choose which components you would like to install. You may always
uninstall them later by re-running "setup-itemupgrade.exe". 

You do *not* need to start a new game to take advantage of anything you
installed. 

The components should install correctly for international players who have
both DIALOG.TLK and DIALOGF.TLK. 

As of v42, Jason Compton's Cespenar audio is available in the main mod for
English-speaking players instead of a separate download. From the original
Cepsenar Audio readme:

  I enjoyed writing many of the lines you see for Cespenar in Westley
  Weimer's Item Upgrade mod. So I decided to have even more fun and breathe
  life into those lines with my best crack at a voice for our favorite imp
  butler.
  
  So, here it is. All 44 "intro" lines to the items that can be upgraded, as
  of IU v42, are here.


		Section III. Items
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The items are listed here with the components on the left and the result on
the right. For example, the first group means that you can forge a Ring of
Protection +1, a Ring of Regeneration, a Diamond and 10,000 gold into a Ring
of Preservation +1. 

[ This mod also fixes Carsomyr +5 and Carsomyr +6 so that they use the same 
  "dispel magic" opcode as the Staff of the Magi. That is, they will
  actually dispel things. They also increase MR by 50% rather than setting
  it to 50%. In addition, the Mace of Disruption +2 now uses the MoD+1 icon. ]

WARNING! Do not use ShadowKeeper to give yourself the components for an
upgrade and then complain that Cromwell and Cespy won't let you do the
upgrade. ShadowKeeper will often list multiple entries for an item (e.g.,
there are two "Pearl"s and two "Wand of Lightning"s in ShadowKeeper's item
list) -- but only one of them is really found in the game and only one of
them will work with the Item Upgrade mod. If you give yourself the wrong
one (and it is easy to do since they have the same name) you won't be able
to do the upgrade. 


		Section IV. Known Bugs
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Cespenar can sometimes "drop reagents". You will still get your upgrade,
but you might get some of the gems back or something. 


		Section V. Thanks
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Special thanks to Jason Compton for the Cespenar dialogue. Thanks to GB for
testing the ITM files. 

Thanks to Artemidore for the French translation!

Thanks to Maus for the German translation!

And a big "thank you" to all of the people on alt.games.baldurs-gate who
answered my survey. The items were balanced according to your
specifications. 


		Section V. FAQ (Spoilers)
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Q: Why can't I talk to Lilarcor?

A: Lilarcor +5 is controlled by the mind flayer circlet and thus prevented
from having complete conversations. He will still banter with you (e.g.,
"Booring!" or "Throw a coin in that fountain!") while you're standing
around. 


Q: Does the Ring of Elemental Mastery include the "hidden" +1 saves
bonus from the Ring of Earth Control?

A: Yes. The "hidden" +1 saves bonus in the Earth Control ring may or may
not be a bug in BG2, but by a large margin users voted to keep the +1
bonus in the RoEM regardless. 


Q: How do I get that many demon hearts?

A: There are three in the Mage Stronghold Quest (the Planar Sphere) and you
only need to give one back to the Sphere to get out. That leaves you with
two spares. You may also use the demon hearts from the maze level of the
Watcher's Keep. That will leave you with 0 to 2 spares.


Q: Where can I get a cursed potion of healing?

A: Nearly every merchant in Athkatla sells the things. Look for the bottle
labeled "Potion of Healing" that isn't blue. The description usually says
something about it being "oddly murky".

		Section VI. Changes
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Version 3 BETA:
        * Initial public release. 
Version 4 BETA:
        * Quiver typo fixed. Thanks Jason Whittaker. 
Version 5:
        * Big Cespy dialogue from Jason Compton, master of BGII humor.
        * Require Contingency scrolls instead of Chain Contingency (forum
          suggestion).
        * Require 2 elven holy water instead of 3 (you can still use one on
          Bodhi, even though you don't really need it).
        * Fixed Ring-Mastery fire-res bug.
        * Fixed a bug where you'd get the wrong boots back. 
        * OK, talking Lilarcor by popular demand. You can't "converse" with
          him, but he'll still banter every once in a while. 
        * Daystar upgrade now really only takes 2 vials of holy water.
          Thanks to Jason Whittaker.
        * Cromwell spelling fixes by Necardan. 
        * The lovely CF description from Homunculus has been included.
        * Hallowed Redeemer +5 is now +5 (not +2). Thanks, Kreese. 
Version 6:
        * Celestial Fury demon heart requirement can now be satisfied by
          those demon hearts from the Watcher's Keep. 
        * Ammo of Plenty +3 - Arrows. Fixed a typo that would prevent you
          from ever  getting it. Thanks to Reiella Darksythe for
          identifying this problem. 
Version 7:
        * Added the Holy Buckler and Thief Glove upgrades based on user
          suggestions.
Version 8:
        * Fixed a typo in the Cespy dialogue that was preventing ToB
          installation. Thanks, John Aprile.
        * Jason Compton Deity fix. 
Version 9:
        * Pitchwife now actually gives 25% MR. Thanks, Bengtson.
Version 10:
        * Added Amulet of Ilmater. Thanks, Mike Barnes. 
        * Fixed a bug with the thief gauntlets. 
Version 11:
        * Added Water's Talon, Azuredge +4. 
        * Also included: Fix to the monster weapon "P3-12M4" to make it +4
          (as it should be, see other ?X-YM4.ITM files) instead of +1.
          This might actually make it worthwhile to cast the Gate spell,
          for instance. 
Version 12:
        * Changed the throwing spear animation.
        * Added Sorcerian Ring, Girdle of Glory. 
Version 13:
        * Amaunator Avatar now gives 3 Sunstone gems as well as Saving
          Grace. :-)
        * Fixed Girdle-Cromwell bug and Cespy typo. Thanks, Kish. 
Version 14:
        * Fixed Girdle bug (again!?).
Version 15:
        * Upgraded to the newer WeiDU. 
Version 16:
        * Fixed typo in README about Girdle of Glory!
        * Upgraded Corthala Family armor now disables spellcasting. 
Version 17:
        * Fixed a bug where Cespy would talk about flaming swords even if
          you didn't have them. Thanks, Reiella. 
Version 18:
        * Fixed "recity" typo, thanks Artemidore. 
        * Folk README fixes. 
        * Fixed more typos, thanks to Azaelus. 
Version 19:
        * French translation of the README, etc. No new items. 
Version 20:
        * Fixed a bug with the French installation (caused by missing
          translations).

        * Fixed a bug with Upgraded Firecam Armor usability. Thanks to
          Andrew Wong.
        * Added a German Translation by Maus. Thanks!

          know if you find it well-balanced or not. 
        * You can now say "goodbye" to Cespy and Crom after looking at Item
          Upgrade Mod upgrades if you don't want to sit through their
          normal offerings. 
        * Fixed some typos mentioned by Michel. Thanks!
        * Added some missing information to item descriptions. Thanks Maus! 
Version 22:
        * Fixed some typos. Thanks, Tyrus. 
        * Fixed some more typos. Thanks, forum members. 
        * Fixed a typo in a setup file that was causing the items to appear
          in French when you picked the German translation. Thanks to
          Rebecca for pointing this out. 
        * Updated german translation. Thanks, Maus!
Version 23:
        * Minor typos fixed, thanks forum members. 
        * Azuredge icon fix for second ability. 
        * Daystar no-charge bug fixed. Thanks Gorrister. 
        * Added Haer'Dalis upgrades. Special thanks to Jeanne Burch. 
        * Added Incarnadine Chain. Thanks to Renmauzo and Renegade. 
Version 24:
        * Installing the mod now changes the Mace of Disruption +2 icon so
          that it looks like the MoD+1 icon. Thanks, Moonfruit. 
        * Fixed a bug in the Ilmater Amulet's heal power. Thanks, Dashael. 
        * Fixed a possible bug in Chaos that was causing it to not confuse
          things. Now it behaves just like the wizard spell (except only 5%
          of the time). 
        * Added Cocobard's French translation.
Version 25:
        * More French translations from Cocobard. 
        * More German translations from Norbert Frischauf. 
        * Azuredge now really does have different icons for ranged and

          working correctly. 
        * Arvoreen: No longer blocks Haste. 
        * Upgrade to a newer WeiDU. Hopefully this will help out Mac users. 
Version 27:
        * Fixed that Azuredge icon (really this time). 
        * Included Spanish Translation by Clan DLAN & friends. Thanks!
Version 28:
        * Updated Spanish Translation.
        * Rassadihn fixes: 
          * Woodlands saving throw fix.
          * Massive typo fixes for American, French and German. 
          * Girdle of Glory can now be made with 3 bloodstone gems or 3
            bloodstone rings or 3 bloodstone amulets. No mix-and-match,
            though. 
          * Archmagi robes now require a *cloak* or protection not a *ring*
            of protection. 
Version 29:
        * Fixed a bug in the Holy Buckler involving magic resistance.
          Thanks, SixofSpades.
Version 30:
        * Quietus inflicts piercing damage. Thanks, Dawid Piotrowski.

Version 31:
        * Russian Translation by Iogan & AERIE.RU. Thanks!
        * Updated German translation by Patrick Lainer. Thanks!
Version 33 (updated by CamDawg):
        * Cromwell and Cespenar dialogues no longer replace critical states, 
	  making it much easier for other mods to interact with IU
        * Fixed broken index for c2blun02.itm. On OS X, a bad index causes
          BG2 to crash to desktop. Additionally, the indexing error can
	  cause other mod installations (i.e. Quest Pack) to fail.
        * Changes to Carsomyr and p3-12m4.itm (demon weapon) are now done
	  via patch instead of overwrite
        * Lilarcor +5, like the original, was permanently setting an
	  immunity to the confusion animation instead of simply preventing
	  it while equipped. The original Lilarcor is fixed by the BG2
	  Fixpack.
        * Severl items had minor effects (such as a color set) failing due
	  to incorrect timings and magic resistance checks
        * Closed usability loopholes on Entropy, Chaos, Hallowed Redeemer +5
	  and Sword of Arvoreen +5
        * Upgraded Corthala Family Armor now displays Mind Shield icon
Version 34 (updated by CamDawg):
        * Fixed broken index for c2staf01.itm. On OS X, a bad index causes
          BG2 to crash to desktop. Additionally, the indexing error can
	  cause other mod installations (i.e. Quest Pack) to fail.
Version 35 (updated by CamDawg):
        * Added Korean translation, courtesy of web2air.
Version 36:
        * Updated Spanish translation. Immortality and her gang etc.
Version 37:
        * Ditto.
Version 38:	(updated by Lollorian)
        * IU can now also use standard BGII-ToB upgrading methods as separate
	  components (translations by:
		- Ancalagon el Negro (spanish)
		- morgan (polski) - also found typos in the english .tra AND revised the
		  original polish setup.tra
		- Hawkmoon, Aldark & prowler (russian)
        * Added README and VERSION tags
        * Added Lich's fixed c2ax1h01.itm
	  (http://kerzenburg.baldurs-gate.eu/showpost.php?p=903720&postcount=1008)
        * Expanded item checks for Gloves of Master Thief, Amulet of Ilmater,
	  Sorcerian Ring and Girdle of Glory
        * Smiths now properly destroy Aeger's Hide +3 (used to destroy Human Flesh
	  +5)
        * Smiths no longer take Poisoned Throwing Daggers when doing Haer'Dalis'
	  upgrade
Version 39: (updated by Lollorian)
        * repairs ( http://forums.pocketplane.net/index.php/topic,27176.msg327010.html#msg327010 )
	  ( http://forums.pocketplane.net/index.php/topic,27541.msg326886.html#msg326886 )
        * French translation repairs from Sanctifer of the d'Oghmatiques
        * WeiDU update to v231
Version 40: (updated by CamDawg)
        * Items were run through the immunity effect batch fixes from the BG2 Fixpack since
          most provided incomplete protections: Amulet of Ilmater, Tower of Iron Will, Citadel
          Helmet, Improved Firecam Plate, Sword of Arvoreen, Shield of Harmony, Throwing Unicorn
          Spear, Corthala Family Armor, Lilarcor, and Water's Talon
        * Delryn Family Shield now casts PFNM directly so that it'll keep up with compatibility,
          i.e. new projectiles from 1PP and elsewhere
        * Azuredge copied over the same bug as the original Azuredge in that its 'Undead Destroyed'
          message would never be seen due to effect misordering
        * Closed exploit where Daystar, Azuredge and Skullcrusher's specific bonuses would apply 
          to the other equipped weapon if dual-wielded. This also addresses a bug where these 
          items would hurt the wielder when equipped if the BG2 Fixpack was installed
        * Daystar's damage was incorrect vs. evil undead
        * Blizzard Boots were using the Resist Fire/Cold portrait icon instead of Protection from
          Cold
        * Redundant AC bonus from Gloves of the Master Thief removed
        * Quietus could cause blindness AND sleep on 1% of hits
        * Elves and half-elves will now have their regular sleep/charm immunity from the 
          upgraded items if BG2 Fixpack is installed
        * Improved Kitthix's web and poison attacks had an incorrect duration
        * Ring of Elemental Control now casts Improved Invisibility directly instead of simulating
          it (compatibility); the charm effect is now limited to elementals
        * The Ring of Wizardry and the Sorcerian Ring can no longer be worn concurrently (Wes had
          coded this, but left a loophole open)
        * Shield of Harmony had the wrong AC vs. missile attacks
        * All of the upgraded spears had the wrong range, wrong attack animation mix, and were
          doing pure piercing damage when thrown instead of the proper missile/piercing
        * The charm animal ability of the Staff of the Woodlands was causing spurious save messages
        * Power levels on the upgraded Celestial Fury are now correct
        * Improved Human Flesh had a spurious move silently bonus
        * The dispel-on-hit abilities of the Hallowed Redeemer and Unholy Reaver weren't fully
          dispelling all effects
        * The branches for the Shield of Harmony update (in the compatibility version of both
          components) were reversed, preventing upgrades when you had all components and 
          allowing them with only the shield
        * All upgrades now account for the 'alternate' versions of items created by the P&P
          Protection Items and Two-Handed Katana components of BG2 Tweaks
        * All items now have relevant tooltip entries for their abilities
        * The new magical armor and protection items can no longer be worn together
        * The item icon for Teleomortis had a pink shadow when moved
        * The Bag of Plenty icon was not transparent when in inventory
        * The existing Quiver of Plenty now uses the restored icon found by Unfinished Business; 
          the upgraded version now uses a variant of the restored icon
        * Quiver of Plenty, Case of Plenty, and Bag of Plenty upgrades were allowing use
          without non-proficiency penalties
        * Quiver of Plenty and Case of Plenty now use the correct ground icons
        * The Enchanced Robes of the Archmagi now provide magic resistance portrait icons
        * The SoA and ToB components are now wholly independent
        * Other minor fixes, such as a few items with incorrect weights or usability flags
        * Minor description fixes, such as multiple THACO > THAC0 typos
        * Future-proofed descriptions for BG2EE
Version 41: (updated by CamDawg)
        * Added French translation - thanks to Sanctifer, of the d'Oghmatiques
        * Added EE-specific Polish translation - thanks to Cahir
        * Character sets will now be converted as appropriate for EE games
        * Suppressed 'Revised versions' options for languages that do not have the translation
        * Amulet of Ilmater was incorrectly providing immunity from disease damage
        * Corrected weight of Teleomortis, Quietus, Citadel Helmet, and Tower of Iron Will
        * Corrected speed factor of Inevitable Entropy and Daystar +4
        * Creatures of 4 HD or less were not getting a save chance against Creeping Chaos' 
          confusion effect
        * Tower of Iron Will and Shield of Harmony +3  were missing a handful of psionic
          protections
        * Free action effect on the Improved Firecam Full-Plate Armor and the Sword of 
          Arvoreen +5 needed some touchups
        * Improved Human Flesh was not protecting its wearer from poison
        * The Bag of Plenty +3 was providing +4 to-hit
        * Celestial Fury +5's stun effect now provides combat feedback
        * Fixed power levels on Water's Talon +4
        * Ring of Wizardry upgrade now accounts for the alternate introduced by EE/Fixpack v11
Version 42: (updated by CamDawg)
        * The mod now accounts for EET games
        * v41 was using an outdated version of the Polish translation (Cam's fault) which was
          causing text issues (at best) or crashes (at worst) for Polish players
        * Cam was also using an older French translation.   
        * The Cespenar audio, previously available as a separate download, is now integrated
          into the mainline mod. The audio is English-only.
        * The English item descriptions for EE games have been revised to better fit in with
          the EE style
Version 43: (updated by CamDawg)
        * Polish translation should no longer crash EE games (for real this time)
        * argent77 had made a macro to help EE-ify item descriptions from vanilla item
          descriptions; this is now used for the Korean and Russian translations since
          they lack a dedicated, EE-specific translation
        * NPC-restricted items will now use the same restriction schemes as their parent
          items for EE games
        * Fixed a bug where the some install options were not available for Polish players
        * Items which provide immunity to poison now also block Cloudkill
Version 44: (updated by CamDawg)
        * Fixed bug where the Incarnadine Elven Chain upgrade asked for three fire agate gems,
          but actually checked and used Dispel Magic scrolls. 
        * Updated the Sorcerian Ring to account for the alternate Rings of Wizardry (aka
          Reaching Ring) in EE/newer Fixpack games. 
        * Lowercased all sound references in dialogue to fix audio issues on case-sensitive
          file systems. 
Version 45: (updated by CamDawg)
        * Fixed bug where the Sorcerian Ring formula was not accounting for the alternate 
          Reaching Ring in BG2EE. 
        * Resolved compatibility issue with the SCS component "Make spell sequencers, spell 
          triggers, and contingencies learnable by all mages". If installed, it removes all 
          scrolls of Contingency from the game. In that case, you will need a scroll of
          Globe of Invulnerability instead of Contingency for the archmagi robe formulas. 
          However, this requires SCS of version > v32.8. 
Version 46: (updated by CamDawg)
        * The compatibility fix with SCS introduced in v45 would fail if SCS was installed
          first due to a bad path. SCS Should be installed after Item Upgrade regardless.
